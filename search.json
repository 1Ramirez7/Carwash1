    "text": "This is my first portfolio that I made. This portfolio was made from a template provided by my Data Science 250 course. The main object of this portfolio is to introduce me to github, and start my project build up. This project is first starting with my Data Science 250 projects, and my resume. This is my first semester (Jan to Apr 2024) working with HTML and github and my second semester working with Python. I’m fairly new to coding and or computer science, but computer science was my career choice up until 9th grade so I’m able to understand many of the coding languages fairly quickly.\n\n\nI made a few models and projects for my Intermediate Macroeconomics course, and hopefully I can uopload them to this portfolio by the end of the semester. I also made one CFA institute research for a US firm and hope to upload it here as well."
